The easiest way to merge your new code into an existing Github repo is to firstly clone that repo. Then delete everything from that folder EXCEPT .git & deploy.bat. Then copy all the stuff from the new folder where your new code lies, EXCEPT those 2 things. Then simply running deploy.bat (which is actually the same old deploy.bat in the existing Github repo) will be a great success.
